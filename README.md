# CRetinex
Code for "CRetinex: A Progressive Color-shift Aware Retinex Model for Low-light Image Enhancement" (IJCV 2024).

## Introduction:
This method can keep the color constancy of the low-light image (as can be seen from the enhancement results of the low-light images captured of the same scene).

<br>


## Recommended Environment:
python=3.6<br>
tensorflow-gpu=1.14.0<br>
numpy=1.19<br>
scikit-image=0.17.2<br>
pillow=8.2<br>

### __To train__:
* __Training dataset:__
  *  Download the training data: [LOL](https://daooshee.github.io/BMVC2018website/), [AGLIE](https://phi-ai.buaa.edu.cn/project/AgLLNet/index.htm), and [SID](https://github.com/cchen156/Learning-to-See-in-the-Dark) datasets.
  * Select part of the data for training, and put the low-light images and corresponding normal-light images in `./dataset/low/` and `./dataset/high/`, respectively.
  * Can also put a small number of paired low-light and normal-light images in `./dataset/eval/low/` and `./dataset/eval/high/` for validation during the training phase.

* __Train the decomposition network:__<br>
  * Run ```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train_decomposition_network.py```<br>
  * The relevant files are stored in `./checkpoint/decom/`, `./logs/decom/`, and `./eval_result/decom/`

* __Train the color shift estimation network:__<br>
  * Run ```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train_color_network.py```<br>
  * The relevant files are stored in `./checkpoint/color_net/`, `./logs/color_net/`, and `./eval_result/color/`

* Train the spatially variant pollution estimation network:<br>
  * Run ```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train_noise_network.py```<br>
  * The relevant files are stored in `./checkpoint/noise_net/`, `./logs/noise_net/`, and `./eval_result/noise/`

* __Train the illumination adjustment network:__<br>
  * Run ```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train_illu_adjust_network.py```<br>
  * The relevant files are stored in `./checkpoint/illu_adjust/`, `./logs/illu_adjust/`, and `./eval_result/illu_adjust/`

### To test:
  * Put the test data in `./test_images/`
  * Run ```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python test.py```<br>
